# pubrepo
A set of open-source libraries that provide an OIDC and CIBA RPs and consume Open Bankin APIs.

This is currently a work in progress - what it does, it does correctly and well, but it does not do everything under the sun.

The repo consists of a number of NPM packages - these are currently not published out to NPM, but will be eventually.

Read the individual readme.md files for each package for details of what they each do.
